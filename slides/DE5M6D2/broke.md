### Think of a time when a system broke at work

- For example: System failure, data pipeline break, application outage
- Focus on the organizational response, not just the technical issue

### Each learner shares briefly

- **What broke?** (brief technical context)
- **How did people find out?** (detection method)
- **Who got involved?** (response team/escalation)
- **How long to fix?** (resolution time)
- **What was learned?** (if anything)

## Reframe Quality as Operations

- Yesterday you handled incidents
- Today's challenge is more subtle: systems work, but output isn't meeting standards
- Requires the same systematic thinking, but different detection and response approaches

### SYSTEM INCIDENTS

- Pipeline stops working
- Clear failure signal
- Immediate impact
- Technical fix needed

### DATA QUALITY ISSUES

- Pipeline produces unreliable data
- Subtle degradation signal
- Gradual impact
- Process/standards fix needed

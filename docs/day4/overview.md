# Day 4 ~ Instructions & Overview

## Welcome to Day 4: *Improvement & Value*.

Today, you'll work in teams to simulate a real-world DataOps project using agile methods. Your mission is to improve a data pipeline over three focused sprints - each targeting a different operational goal.

By the end of the day, you'll have:

- Planned and executed a small Scrum project
- Made a pipeline observable, resilient, and governed
- Practiced teamwork, monitoring, and incident response
- Presented your work and reflected on what you've learned

### A complete pipeline is available in a GitHub repo

- [Instructions](https://github.com/ingwanelabs/etl-pipeline/tree/main/etl#readme)
- Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/ingwanelabs/etl-pipeline/blob/main/etl/data-enrichment_load.ipynb

## How the Day Works

We'll use a **mini Scrum** structure with three timeboxed sprints:

| Sprint | Theme              | Focus                                  |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Make it Observable | Logging, monitoring, visibility        |
| 2      | Make it Resilient  | Error handling, alerts, recoverability |
| 3      | Make it Governed   | Validation, versioning, improvements   |

Each sprint includes:

- **Planning**: Quickly decide what to do and who will do it
- **Execution**: Work as a team to build and improve
- **Stand-Up**: Share progress, blockers, next steps

And at the end of the 3 sprints:

- **Review**: Demo your pipeline and explain decisions
- **Retrospective**: Reflect on what went well and what to improve

### Working in Teams

- You'll work in groups of 3–5 learners.
- Just like in Scrum ~ there are no allocated roles.
- You can work as a team, or individually.
- You can build on the work of others, within a sprint, and also across sprints.

## Your Challenge

> You are a DataOps team responsible for improving a deployed data pipeline to ensure it's observable, resilient, and governed.

You'll be given a complete pipeline (or you can start from scratch) and work in sprints to:

- Add meaningful logs and visibility
- Simulate and respond to failures
- Build quality and governance into your process

### What You’ll Present

At the end of the day, your team will:

- **Demo** your working pipeline
- **Explain** how it evolved through the sprints
- **Reflect** on challenges and improvements

---

### **Tools You'll Use**

You can use any tools that you have availalble. Including:

- Microsoft Fabric / Notebooks / Pipelines
- GitHub for collaboration (optional)
- Trello or physical boards for task tracking
- Logs, markdown files, or screenshots to support your demo

!!! warning "Just remember that the MS Fabric lab is 3 hours. So download any notebooks before lunch!"

## Tips for Success

- Start small — get a working version early, then improve it
- Work iteratively — you don’t have to perfect everything in Sprint 1
- Communicate often — check in with your team regularly
- Be prepared to demo and explain your work clearly

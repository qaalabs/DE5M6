# Day 2: Real-World Connections & Response Planning
**Time:** 14:50-15:45 (55 minutes)  
**Learning Types:** Investigation → Production

---

## Overview
This final Day 2 session connects all the incident response learning - from pipeline breaking to major outage analysis - with learners' real workplace contexts. They investigate their organization's actual incident procedures, then create a practical response checklist that synthesizes today's experiences with workplace reality.

---

## Session Structure

### Phase 1: Workplace Incident Procedures Investigation (25 minutes)

#### Introduction & Setup (3 minutes)

**Context Setting:**
- "Today you've practiced breaking pipelines and studied how major companies handle incidents"
- "Now let's connect this to your actual workplace - what procedures exist and how do they work?"
- "Goal: Understand what's already in place and identify potential gaps"

**Investigation Approach:**
- **Individual research** into their own organization's procedures
- **Focus areas:** Detection, escalation, communication, resolution
- **Honest assessment:** What works well? What doesn't? What's missing?

#### Structured Investigation Framework (20 minutes)

Provide learners with this research template to complete:

### **Current Detection Methods (5 minutes)**

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
- What monitoring tools does your organization use for data/IT systems?
- How do alerts get delivered? (email, Slack, phone calls, dashboards)
- Who receives alerts initially?
- Are there different alert levels/severities?

**User Reporting:**
- How do users report problems? (helpdesk, direct contact, formal tickets)
- How quickly do user reports reach technical teams?
- Is there a way to distinguish urgent vs. routine issues?

### **Escalation Procedures (5 minutes)**

**Response Team Structure:**
- Who responds to incidents initially? (on-call rotation, specific team, whoever's available)
- What's the escalation path? (team lead → manager → director)
- Are there different procedures for different types of incidents?
- How quickly are escalations supposed to happen?

**Decision Authority:**
- Who can make decisions about system changes during incidents?
- Who authorizes emergency fixes vs. waiting for approval?
- Is there clear authority for communication decisions?

### **Communication Protocols (5 minutes)**

**Internal Communication:**
- How do teams coordinate during incidents? (Slack, email, calls, war rooms)
- What information gets shared and when?
- How are different stakeholders kept informed?

**External Communication:**
- Who decides what to communicate to users/customers?
- What channels are used? (status page, email, website notice)
- Are there templates or guidelines for incident communication?
- How often are updates provided?

### **Documentation & Learning (5 minutes)**

**Incident Tracking:**
- How are incidents documented? (tickets, reports, logs)
- What information is captured about each incident?
- Is there a post-incident review process?

**Continuous Improvement:**
- How does your organization learn from incidents?
- Are there regular reviews of incident response effectiveness?
- Do procedures get updated based on lessons learned?
- Is incident response training provided?

#### Facilitator Role During Investigation:
- **Support individual reflection** - this may reveal gaps or frustrations
- **Encourage honest assessment** - "What really happens vs. what's supposed to happen?"
- **Help with difficult questions** - "If you don't know, that's valuable information too"
- **Keep focus practical** - real procedures, not idealized policies

#### Common Findings to Expect:
- **Informal procedures** - "We just call John when things break"
- **Communication gaps** - unclear who tells customers about problems
- **Tool proliferation** - different teams use different monitoring tools
- **Documentation gaps** - procedures exist but aren't written down

### Phase 2: Incident Response Checklist Creation (30 minutes)

#### Introduction & Framework (5 minutes)

**Purpose:**
- "Create a practical checklist you could actually use during an incident"
- "Combine today's learning with your workplace reality"
- "Focus on actionable steps, not perfect theoretical procedures"

**Checklist Structure:**
Provide this template framework:

### **Incident Response Checklist Template**

#### **Phase 1: Detection & Initial Assessment (5 minutes to complete)**

**When you discover an incident:**
- [ ] Confirm the issue is real (not user error or temporary glitch)
- [ ] Identify affected systems/users
- [ ] Assess severity level
- [ ] Check monitoring systems for additional context
- [ ] Document initial findings

**Key Questions:**
- How do I quickly confirm this is a real incident?
- What systems should I check to understand scope?
- Who needs to know immediately vs. who can wait?

#### **Phase 2: Response & Escalation (8 minutes to complete)**

**Immediate Response Actions:**
- [ ] Follow escalation procedure for this severity level
- [ ] Notify appropriate team members
- [ ] Begin initial troubleshooting
- [ ] Set up communication channel if needed
- [ ] Start incident log/timeline

**Communication Checklist:**
- [ ] Internal notification sent
- [ ] Stakeholders identified
- [ ] External communication decision made
- [ ] First update provided (even if just "we're investigating")

**Key Questions:**
- Who exactly do I contact and how?
- What information do I need before escalating?
- How do I balance fixing vs. communicating?

#### **Phase 3: Resolution & Recovery (8 minutes to complete)**

**Resolution Actions:**
- [ ] Implement fix (emergency patch vs. proper solution)
- [ ] Test that systems are working properly
- [ ] Monitor for stability
- [ ] Confirm with affected users
- [ ] Update all communication channels

**Recovery Verification:**
- [ ] System performance back to normal
- [ ] No secondary issues created
- [ ] Data integrity confirmed if applicable
- [ ] User access restored

**Key Questions:**
- How do I know the fix actually worked?
- What could go wrong with this fix?
- Who needs to verify recovery?

#### **Phase 4: Post-Incident Activities (4 minutes to complete)**

**Immediate Wrap-up:**
- [ ] Final communication sent
- [ ] Incident documentation completed
- [ ] Lessons learned captured
- [ ] Schedule post-incident review if needed

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [ ] Root cause analysis scheduled
- [ ] Preventive measures identified
- [ ] Procedure updates recommended
- [ ] Team feedback collected

**Key Questions:**
- What would prevent this from happening again?
- What went well/poorly in our response?
- What procedures need updating?

#### Individual Customization (15 minutes):
**Adaptation Instructions:**
- **Modify template** based on their workplace investigation findings
- **Add specific contacts** - names, phone numbers, communication channels
- **Include organization-specific tools** - monitoring systems, ticketing tools
- **Adjust severity levels** - match their workplace definitions
- **Add missing steps** - fill gaps they identified in current procedures

**Focus Areas:**
- Make it actionable for their specific role and organization
- Include lessons from today's breaking exercises
- Reference insights from major outage case studies
- Address gaps they identified in workplace procedures

#### Facilitator Support:
- **Circulate and provide guidance** on customization
- **Help with difficult decisions** - "What would you actually do in this situation?"
- **Encourage practicality** - "What would work at 2am under pressure?"
- **Connect to today's learning** - "Remember what you learned from the Facebook outage case study"

### Wrap-up & Sharing (5 minutes)

#### Quick Sharing Round (3 minutes):
Each learner shares **one key insight** (30 seconds each):
- "The biggest gap I found in our current procedures is..."
- "One thing I'm adding to my checklist that we don't do now is..."
- "The most important lesson from today for real incidents is..."

#### Bridge to Tomorrow (2 minutes):
- "Today we focused on 'when things break' - detection and response"
- "Tomorrow we'll look at 'when things work but aren't good enough' - quality and governance"
- "The systematic thinking you've practiced today applies to quality issues too"
- "Your checklists will be useful for tomorrow's governance scenarios"

## Resources for Trainers

### Pre-Session Preparation:
- **Review common organizational structures** to help guide learners' investigation
- **Prepare examples** of good vs. poor incident procedures to reference
- **Have backup scenarios** ready if learners struggle with workplace reflection

### Supporting Individual Work:

**If someone says "We don't have procedures":**
- "That's valuable information - what actually happens when things break?"
- "Who do people call? How do decisions get made?"
- "Informal procedures are still procedures"

**If someone is frustrated with their workplace procedures:**
- "Focus on what you can control and influence"
- "Your checklist can be a model for improvements"
- "Understanding gaps is the first step to addressing them"

**If someone works for a very small organization:**
- "Adapt the template to your context - maybe you ARE the escalation path"
- "Focus on external resources and support you could call on"
- "Simple procedures can be very effective"

### Managing Sensitive Information:
- **Encourage general patterns** rather than specific details
- **Focus on process improvement** rather than criticism
- **Frame as learning opportunity** for better incident response

### Time Management:
- **Investigation phase can expand** easily - keep learners focused on the framework
- **Checklist creation is the priority** - that's their tangible takeaway
- **Sharing can be shortened** if needed to ensure checklist completion

### Expected Outcomes:

**Investigation Insights:**
- **Awareness of current procedures** (formal and informal)
- **Identification of gaps** in detection, escalation, or communication
- **Understanding of organizational context** for incident response

**Practical Output:**
- **Customized incident response checklist** they can actually use
- **Integration of today's learning** with workplace reality
- **Actionable steps** for improving incident response

**Preparation for Tomorrow:**
- **Systematic thinking approach** applicable to quality and governance issues
- **Understanding of procedure development** for operational processes

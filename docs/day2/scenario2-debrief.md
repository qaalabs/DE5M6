# Scenario 2 ~ Debrief

## Scenario 2 Debrief Elements You Can Use:

**From the Escalation Card:**

- **Partial success complexity** - pipeline running but 40% data still missing
- **CEO involvement** - board meeting happened with incomplete data
- **Multiple new stakeholders** - Legal, Data Protection Officer, Marketing Director
- **External pressures** - Media inquiry, competitor actions, formal client complaints
- **Complex decisions** - technical vs. workaround, legal/compliance implications

**CEO Briefing Observations:**

- **Communication effectiveness** - which teams translated technical issues clearly?
- **Executive presence** - how did teams handle direct CEO questioning?
- **Decision confidence** - who gave firm commitments vs. hedged their answers?
- **Resource requests** - what support did teams ask for?

**Cross-Team Comparison:**

- **Risk assessment approaches** - legal, competitive, technical priorities
- **Communication strategies** - public vs. internal messaging decisions
- **Timeline commitments** - conservative vs. aggressive promises
- **Escalation handling** - how teams managed multiple senior stakeholders

## Rich Debrief Questions:

**CEO Briefing Analysis:**

- "Which team's CEO briefing felt most/least confident?"
- "How did teams balance honesty about problems with leadership expectations?"
- "What made some technical explanations clearer than others?"

**Decision-Making Under Pressure:**

- "How did teams handle the legal/compliance questions?"
- "Which risk assessments seemed most comprehensive?"
- "How did competitive pressure affect your communication decisions?"

**Stakeholder Juggling:**

- "How did teams prioritize between CEO, Legal, Marketing, and technical needs?"
- "Which external pressures (media, competitors) influenced your approach most?"

## Extended DMBOK Activity (50 mins)

- **Investigation: DMBOK's 6 quality dimensions (pairs) - 30 mins** (same)
- **Discussion: Report back findings - 10 mins** (same)
- **NEW: Application exercise - 10 mins** (extends the learning)

The **new 10-minute application exercise** could be:

- **"Quality Assessment Practice"** - give them a sample data scenario and have them apply the 6 DMBOK dimensions to assess it
- **"Workplace Quality Mapping"** - have them identify which DMBOK dimensions are most problematic in their current work
- **"Quality Metrics Design"** - pairs create specific quality metrics for one dimension

This extension would make the learning more practical and set up the Medallion lab better, since they'll have deeper understanding of the quality framework before seeing it applied to bronze/silver/gold layers.

# Day 1: Monitoring Strategy Creation
---

## Overview
This production activity synthesizes everything learners have experienced today - the labs, status page analysis, and cloud platform research - into a comprehensive monitoring strategy. Working in pairs, they create a tangible monitoring framework that could be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Session Structure

### Setup Instructions (3 minutes)

#### Scenario Assignment:

Give each pair a realistic scenario to make their strategy concrete:

**Scenario A: E-commerce Data Platform**

- Real-time customer behaviour tracking
- Daily sales reporting pipelines  
- Inventory management data feeds
- Customer impact: Revenue loss if data is stale/incorrect

**Scenario B: Healthcare Analytics**

- Patient data processing pipelines
- Clinical reporting systems
- Research data aggregation
- Customer impact: Patient safety and regulatory compliance

**Scenario C: Financial Services**

- Transaction processing monitoring
- Risk calculation pipelines
- Regulatory reporting systems
- Customer impact: Financial losses and regulatory penalties

**Scenario D: Manufacturing IoT**

- Sensor data ingestion from factory floor
- Predictive maintenance pipelines
- Quality control data processing
- Customer impact: Production delays and safety risks

### Strategy Development Phase (20 minutes)

#### Framework Template:

Provide pairs with this structured template to complete:

### **1. What We Monitor (5 minutes)**

Define the key monitoring areas:

**Data Pipeline Health:**

- [ ] Pipeline execution status (success/failure)
- [ ] Processing time/latency
- [ ] Data volume trends
- [ ] Error rates and types

**Data Quality:**

- [ ] Completeness (missing records)
- [ ] Accuracy (data validation failures)  
- [ ] Freshness (data age/staleness)
- [ ] Schema changes/drift

**Infrastructure & Performance:**

- [ ] Resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage)
- [ ] Cost monitoring
- [ ] Scalability metrics
- [ ] Security events

### **2. How We Monitor (5 minutes)**

Choose tools and methods:

**Monitoring Tools:**

- Primary platform: ________________
- Dashboard tools: ________________
- Alerting method: ________________
- Log aggregation: ________________

**Monitoring Approach:**

- [ ] Real-time monitoring
- [ ] Batch/scheduled checks
- [ ] Trend analysis
- [ ] Predictive monitoring

### **3. When We Alert (5 minutes)**

Define alert thresholds and escalation:

**Critical Alerts (immediate response required):**

- Trigger: _________________________
- Notify: __________________________
- Response time: ___________________

**Warning Alerts (monitor closely):**

- Trigger: _________________________
- Notify: __________________________
- Response time: ___________________

**Information Alerts (awareness only):**

- Trigger: _________________________
- Notify: __________________________

### **4. Who Responds (3 minutes)**

Define roles and responsibilities:

**First Response Team:**

- Role: ____________________________
- Responsibilities: _________________

**Escalation Path:**

- Level 1: _________________________
- Level 2: _________________________
- Level 3: _________________________

### **5. Communication Plan (2 minutes)**

How you communicate during incidents:

**Internal Communication:**

- Method: __________________________
- Frequency: _______________________

**External Communication:**

- Stakeholders: ____________________
- Method: __________________________
- Message template: ________________

---

### Strategy Sharing & Feedback (7 minutes)

#### Rapid Strategy Showcase (5 minutes):

- Each pair screen shares for 60 seconds
- Focus on "one key decision we made and why"
- Other pairs post ONE insight in chat

#### Group Reflection (2 minutes):

- Facilitator reads chat highlights
- "What common themes do you notice?"
- "What surprised you about different approaches?"---

### Expected Outputs:

Each pair should produce:

1. **Completed monitoring strategy template**
2. **Understanding of monitoring complexity**
3. **Appreciation for different monitoring approaches**
4. **Foundation for tomorrow's incident response activities**

# Day 3 Session 4: Deployment Pipelines & Governance Integration
**Time:** 14:50-15:50 (60 minutes)  
**Learning Types:** Practice → Discussion → Production

---

## Overview
This final Day 3 session connects data quality and governance standards with operational deployment practices. Through Lab 21 and structured discussion, learners explore how quality checks and governance controls move across development environments, understanding deployment as the mechanism for operationalizing the standards they've studied throughout the day.

## Session Structure

### Phase 1: Deployment Pipelines Lab (20 minutes)

#### Lab 21: Implement Deployment Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric (20 minutes)
**Microsoft Learn Lab:** [Implement deployment pipelines in Microsoft Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/implement-deployment-pipelines-fabric/)

**Key Learning Focus for Today:**
While completing the lab, learners should think about governance implications:
- **Development environment:** Where do you test data quality rules and security settings?
- **Test environment:** How do you validate governance controls before production?
- **Production environment:** What additional governance restrictions apply here?

**Quality & Governance Mindset During Lab:**
Encourage learners to consider:
- "How would the medallion architecture patterns deploy across these environments?"
- "What security settings from Lab 19 would need to be replicated in each stage?"
- "Where in this pipeline would you implement quality gates?"

**Facilitator Notes:**
- **Emphasize governance context** - this isn't just about moving code, but deploying standards
- **Connect to today's learning:** "How does this relate to the quality frameworks you studied?"
- **Time management:** Keep lab focused on core deployment concepts

#### Quick Lab Reflection (2 minutes):
**Individual reflection:**
- "What governance challenges did you notice in moving content between environments?"
- "Where would quality checks fit into this deployment pipeline?"

### Phase 2: Deployment Governance Discussion (20 minutes)

#### Governance in Deployment Pipelines (18 minutes)

**Setup (2 minutes):**
**Facilitator Frame:**
- "You've just moved data assets between development environments"
- "Now let's explore how governance and quality standards travel with those deployments"
- "This is where all of today's learning comes together - quality, security, and operational deployment"

#### Structured Discussion (14 minutes):

**Quality Gates Analysis (5 minutes):**
**Group discussion around these questions:**
- "Where in the Dev → Test → Prod pipeline should quality checks happen?"
- "What quality standards might be different between environments?"
- "How do you prevent poor quality data from reaching production?"

**Expected insights to highlight:**
- **Development:** Experimental data, relaxed quality rules for exploration
- **Test:** Production-like quality standards, validation of quality rules
- **Production:** Strict quality enforcement, automated quality monitoring

**Security Progression Discussion (5 minutes):**
**Connect to Lab 19 security experience:**
- "How would the security controls you configured earlier deploy across environments?"
- "What security settings should be identical vs. different across environments?"
- "Who should have access to each environment?"

**Expected insights:**
- **Development:** Broader access for development teams, test data
- **Test:** Limited access, production-like security, real-ish data
- **Production:** Restricted access, full security controls, real data

**Governance Decision Framework (4 minutes):**
**Practical governance questions:**
- "Who approves deployments when data quality or security is involved?"
- "What governance checks should be automated vs. require human approval?"
- "How do you balance governance controls with development agility?"

**Key principles to emerge:**
- **Automated where possible:** Quality checks, security validation
- **Human approval for risk:** Production deployments, security changes
- **Environment-appropriate controls:** Different standards for different purposes

#### Bridge to Integration Workshop (2 minutes):
**Facilitator:**
- "You've identified where governance fits into deployment pipelines"
- "Now let's create a practical framework that combines quality, security, and deployment governance"

---

### Phase 3: Governance Integration Workshop (20 minutes)

#### Practical Governance Framework Creation (18 minutes)

**Setup (2 minutes):**
**Workshop Goal:**
"Create a practical governance framework that integrates data quality, security controls, and deployment processes"

**Team Formation:**
- **Groups of 2-3** (depending on class size)
- **Mixed perspectives** if possible - different workplace experiences

#### Framework Template (14 minutes):
**Groups complete this governance integration template:**

```
INTEGRATED DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE:
□ Quality Standards: What quality checks are required?
□ Security Controls: What access restrictions apply?
□ Deployment Rules: Who can deploy what, when?
□ Approval Process: What requires sign-off before moving to test?

TEST ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE:
□ Quality Validation: How do you verify quality rules work correctly?
□ Security Testing: How do you validate security controls?
□ Business Validation: Who tests business functionality?
□ Production Readiness: What criteria must be met before production deployment?

PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE:
□ Quality Monitoring: How do you detect quality issues in production?
□ Security Enforcement: What additional security controls apply?
□ Change Control: What approvals are required for production changes?
□ Incident Response: How do governance issues get escalated and resolved?

GOVERNANCE AUTOMATION:
□ Automated Quality Gates: What quality checks can be automated in the pipeline?
□ Security Automation: What security validations happen automatically?
□ Compliance Reporting: How do you demonstrate governance compliance?
□ Continuous Monitoring: What governance metrics do you track?

STAKEHOLDER RESPONSIBILITIES:
□ Data Engineers: What governance responsibilities do they have?
□ Data Scientists/Analysts: How do they work within governance constraints?
□ Business Users: What governance decisions require their input?
□ IT/Security Teams: How do they support data governance?
```

**Facilitator Role During Workshop:**
- **Circulate between groups** - provide guidance without prescribing solutions
- **Connect to today's experience:** "Think about the medallion quality patterns you implemented"
- **Encourage practical thinking:** "What would actually work in your organization?"
- **Time management:** Keep groups focused on framework completion

#### Quick Sharing (2 minutes):
**Rapid framework highlights:**
Each group shares **one key governance principle** from their framework (20 seconds each):
- "Our most important governance automation would be..."
- "The critical approval gate we identified is..."
- "The governance responsibility that surprised us is..."

## Resources for Trainers

### Pre-Session Preparation:
- **Complete Lab 21** to understand deployment mechanics and potential governance touchpoints
- **Review Day 3 learning** to connect quality/security concepts to deployment
- **Prepare governance examples** from industry best practices if groups struggle

### Managing the Lab Phase:
**Governance Context:**
- **Highlight governance moments:** "Notice how permissions carry over between environments"
- **Connect to earlier labs:** "How would your medallion architecture deploy through these stages?"
- **Time management:** Ensure core deployment understanding, don't get stuck on technical details

### Facilitating Governance Discussion:
**Drawing Out Practical Insights:**
- **Use specific examples:** "In the security lab, you set up row-level security - how does that deploy?"
- **Challenge assumptions:** "Should test and production have identical security controls?"

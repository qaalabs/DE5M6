## Key Points to Cover

### From Personal Pain to Business Impact

- Personal frustration = lost customers/revenue for businesses
- System downtime costs: Amazon loses £2.8M per minute of downtime
- Reputation damage can last longer than the outage

### The Monitoring Pyramid

```none
Business Impact     (Customer complaints, lost revenue)
        ↑
Service Impact      (Application slow/down, data unavailable)
        ↑
Technical Issues    (CPU high, disk full, network timeout)
        ↑
Monitoring Data     (Metrics, logs, alerts)
```

### Key Monitoring Questions

1. **Is it working?** (Availability monitoring)
2. **Is it working well?** (Performance monitoring)  
3. **Will it keep working?** (Predictive monitoring)
4. **When it breaks, how do we know?** (Alerting)
5. **When it breaks, what do we tell people?** (Communication)

## Interactive Elements

- Ask: "Which level of the pyramid do you think most organisations focus on?"
- Quick poll: "Hands up if your workplace monitors at each level"

### Activities

- Create a deployment pipeline
- Assign workspaces to stages of a deployment pipeline
- Create content
- Deploy content between stages

---

## Possible error

- Everyone complete Lab 21
- Try to delete the workspace
- Discuss what the error message teaches us
- "How would you design other operational safeguards?"

### So the proper sequence is

- Unassign the workspace from the deployment pipeline
- Then delete the workspace

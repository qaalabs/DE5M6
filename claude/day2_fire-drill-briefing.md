# Day 2: Fire Drill Briefing

## Trainer Instructions

### Opening
**Dramatic tone:**
"Right, preparation time is over. We have a **LIVE INCIDENT** situation developing with our data platform. You are now the incident response teams for our organization."

**Set the scene:**
"It's a typical workday, you're focused on your regular tasks, when suddenly..."

### Rules & Logistics

**Team Coordination:**
- Your team has a **war room** - your breakout room for internal discussion
- You can plan, debate, and coordinate freely in your team room
- BUT - all **official communication** must go through Slack

**Slack Communication Rules:**
- Use your Slack channel for incident updates to stakeholders
- This is how you communicate with customers, executives, and other teams
- Write professionally - these messages will be reviewed during debrief
- First action should be incident announcement to the channel

**Timing:**
- You have **25 minutes** to handle this incident
- I'll be monitoring your Slack communications
- You *may* recive additional updates or pressure via Slack as the situation develops

### Scenario Distribution (1 minute)
**Hand out scenario cards:**

- Read your scenario and understand the situation
- Then immediately post your first incident update to Slack
- Remember: stakeholders are waiting to hear from you

**Guidelines:**

- Don't watch the other teams 
- Focus on what your team needs to do!

### Success Criteria
**What we're looking for:**

- Clear, professional communication via Slack
- Systematic approach to incident response
- Good coordination within your team
- Balancing technical fixes with stakeholder communication

**Important:**

- There's no single 'right' answer - we're practicing process and communication
- Real incidents are messy and uncertain - embrace that
- Use what you learned from the major incident examples

## Facilitator Actions During Briefing

### Before Starting:
- **Ensure breakout rooms are ready** for each team
- **Confirm Slack channels are set up** and all learners can access
- **Have scenario cards ready** to distribute
- **Set 25-minute timer** visible to all

### During Briefing:
- **Maintain dramatic energy** - this is a real incident simulation
- **Check for questions** but keep momentum high
- **Emphasize Slack communication** - this is key learning objective
- **Watch for any technical issues** with breakout rooms or Slack

### After Briefing:
- **Send teams to breakout rooms immediately** after scenario distribution
- **Monitor Slack channels** for their first posts
- **Prepare to send escalation messages** during the 25-minute period

## Optional Pressure Elements

### During the 25-minute drill, you can add realism by sending these messages:

**5 minutes in:**

*"Customer calls are increasing - service desk getting overwhelmed"*

**10 minutes in:**

*"Social media mentions of our service issues are trending"*

**15 minutes in:**

*"CEO's office is asking for status update"*

**20 minutes in:**

*"Major client just called - they're considering switching providers"*

**Use sparingly** - only if teams seem to be handling the basic scenario well.

## What to Watch For

### During the Drill:

**Slack Communication Quality:**

- Are first posts professional and informative?
- Do they provide regular updates?
- Are messages clear for non-technical audiences?

**Team Coordination:**

- Are they using breakout rooms effectively?
- Is there clear role separation?
- Are decisions being made efficiently?

**Incident Response Process:**

- Do they follow systematic approach?
- Are they balancing technical fixes with communication?
- How do they handle uncertainty?

### Common Issues to Note:

**Communication Problems:**

- Too technical for general audience
- Infrequent updates or radio silence
- Unclear or confusing messaging

**Coordination Issues:**

- All talking at once, no clear leadership
- Forgetting to update Slack while focused on technical discussion
- Paralysis when facing uncertain information

**These become great debrief discussion points!**

## Wrap-up at 25 Minutes

### End the Drill:
**Announcement:**
"Time! Step back from your incident response. Well done everyone."

**Immediate Actions:**

- **Bring all teams back to main room**
- **Keep Slack channels open** for review
- **Prepare for 10-minute quick debrief**

### Transition:
"Before we break, let's do a quick review of your Slack communication and initial responses. Then we'll take a break before the next escalation phase."

## Success Indicators

**Good Simulation if:**

- Teams immediately start coordinating in breakout rooms
- Slack shows professional incident updates within first 5 minutes
- Teams balance technical discussion with communication needs
- Energy level is high and focused

**Adjust if:**

- Teams seem confused about process (provide clarification)
- Slack communication is sparse (remind about stakeholder updates)
- Teams are too stressed (reduce pressure elements)
- Teams finish too quickly (add complexity via Slack updates)

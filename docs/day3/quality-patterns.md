# Day 3: Quality Patterns

---

## Overview

This session combines hands-on experience with medallion architecture (Lab 3b) and structured analysis of how quality patterns are implemented in data architecture. Learners see how the DMBOK quality dimensions they studied earlier are addressed through bronze, silver, and gold layer design, then investigate modern quality tools and approaches.

**Key Learning Focus for Today:**

While completing the lab, learners should pay attention to:

- **Bronze layer:** Raw data ingestion - what quality issues exist here?
- **Silver layer:** Data cleaning and validation - what quality improvements happen?
- **Gold layer:** Business-ready data - what quality standards are enforced?

**Facilitator Notes:**

- **Circulate during lab** to highlight quality aspects as learners work
- **Point out quality transformations:** "Notice how the silver layer handles missing values"
- **Connect to DMBOK:** "This validation step addresses which quality dimension?"
- **Time management:** Keep lab moving - focus on completion over perfection

### Phase 2: Quality Patterns Analysis (20 minutes)

#### Medallion Quality Mapping Discussion (20 minutes)

**Setup (2 minutes):**

**Facilitator Frame:**

- "You've just built a medallion architecture hands-on"
- "Now let's analyze how this pattern addresses the DMBOK quality dimensions you studied earlier"
- "We'll map specific quality improvements to each layer"

#### Structured Quality Analysis (15 minutes):

**Individual Reflection (5 minutes):**
Give learners this framework to complete based on their lab experience:

```
MEDALLION QUALITY MAPPING

BRONZE LAYER - Raw Data:
□ What quality issues did you observe in the raw data?
□ Which DMBOK dimensions had problems here?
□ What was preserved "as-is" and why?

SILVER LAYER - Cleaned Data:  
□ What quality transformations happened in silver?
□ Which DMBOK dimensions were improved?
□ What validation rules were applied?

GOLD LAYER - Business-Ready Data:
□ What additional quality standards were enforced?
□ Which DMBOK dimensions reached "production quality"?
□ What business rules ensured fitness for purpose?

QUALITY PATTERNS OBSERVED:
□ How does this layered approach handle different quality requirements?
□ What are the trade-offs between layers?
□ Where would you add additional quality checks?
```

**Pair Discussion (5 minutes):**
- **Share findings** with a partner (different from morning DMBOK pairs)
- **Compare observations** about quality transformations
- **Identify** one quality improvement they found most effective

**Group Discussion (5 minutes):**
**Facilitator-led analysis:**

**Key Questions:**
- "Which DMBOK dimensions were most improved by the silver layer transformations?"
- "What quality trade-offs did you notice between preserving raw data and cleaning it?"
- "Where would you add additional quality checks if this was a production system?"

**Expected Insights to Highlight:**
- **Bronze preserves completeness** but may sacrifice accuracy
- **Silver improves accuracy and consistency** through validation and standardization
- **Gold ensures fitness for purpose** through business rule application
- **Different layers serve different quality needs** - exploration vs. reporting vs. analytics

#### Bridge to Quality Tools (3 minutes):
**Facilitator:**
- "The medallion pattern gives you architecture for quality improvement"
- "But you need tools to implement and monitor these quality standards"
- "Next we'll investigate modern data quality tools that can automate what you just did manually"

## Course Evaluation

- Make sure to allocate 10 minutes for learners to complete the Live event evaluation
- Evaluation link should have been sent to learners, ask if it has not been.

### Note

QA is moving their evaluation to another system and so you may get two emails asking for course feedback.

For now, please make sure you complete the feedback with the link: evaluation . qa . com
(I think it is the one with the subject: How did your QA course go?)

```
Subject: How did your QA course go? ~ Jane
NOT: Thank you for training with QA ~ feedback@qa.com
```

---

If you don't leave positive feedback (if you only give a 7 or below), it would be great if you could tell us how we can improve

10 :D
9 :)
8 :~
1-7 :(

Please take your time completing feedback - we DO read it!
Thank you!

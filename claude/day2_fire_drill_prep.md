# Day 2: Fire Drill Preparation
**Time:** 13:30-13:50 (20 minutes)

---

## Instructions for Learners

### What's Coming Next
In **20 minutes**, you'll participate in **incident response fire drills** simulating real data platform failures. You'll work in teams to coordinate technical responses and stakeholder communication under time pressure.

### Your Preparation Tasks

#### 1. Form Your Incident Response Team (3 minutes)
**Team Size:** 2-4 people depending on class size

**Assign Roles:**
- **Incident Commander:** Coordinates overall response, makes key decisions
- **Technical Lead:** Investigates root cause, determines fix options  
- **Communications Lead:** Handles stakeholder updates and messaging
- **Business Impact Analyst:** Assesses downstream effects *(if 4 people)*

#### 2. Research Real Incident Examples (15 minutes)
Study these major incidents to understand what works (and what doesn't) in incident response:

**Cloudflare Global DNS Outage - June 21, 2022**
- *27-minute global DNS failure affecting millions of websites*
- **Link:** https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-on-june-21-2022/
- **Key lesson:** Speed vs. accuracy in technical communication

**AWS us-east-1 Outage - December 7, 2021**  
- *5+ hour power-related outage affecting thousands of services*
- **Search:** "AWS us-east-1 outage December 2021 post-mortem"
- **Key lesson:** Cascading failures and dependency management

**GitHub Database Incident - October 21, 2018**
- *24+ hour database cluster failure during maintenance*
- **Search:** "GitHub October 2018 incident post-mortem database"
- **Key lesson:** Incident escalation and technical decision-making

**Meta/Facebook Global Outage - October 4, 2021**
- *6+ hour BGP configuration error taking down all Meta services*
- **Search:** "Facebook outage October 2021 BGP routing"
- **Key lesson:** When monitoring systems fail too

#### 3. Extract Key Principles (Focus your research on these questions)

**Detection & Assessment:**
- How quickly did they recognize the problem?
- What information did they gather before acting?
- How did they assess business impact?

**Technical Response:**
- Did they implement quick fixes or wait for proper solutions?
- How did they coordinate multiple teams?
- What tools and processes helped/hindered them?

**Communication Strategy:**
- When did they first communicate publicly?
- How detailed were their updates?
- How did they handle uncertainty in their messaging?
- What different messages did they send to different audiences?

**Coordination & Decision-Making:**
- Who made key decisions?
- How did they balance speed vs. accuracy?
- What escalation triggers did they use?

### Research Strategy Tips

**Don't try to read everything!** Focus on:
- **Executive summaries** and key timeline points
- **Communication examples** - actual status updates they published
- **Lessons learned** sections in post-mortems
- **Decision points** - when they chose one approach over another

**Look for patterns:**
- What's common across different incidents?
- What approaches consistently work or fail?
- How do companies handle uncertainty in their communication?

### Team Coordination (2 minutes)
- **Share your findings** with your team members
- **Agree on communication approach** - who will handle what during the drill
- **Establish team coordination method** - how will you make quick decisions together?

## Facilitator Notes

### Setup Instructions:
- **Prepare Slack workspace** with team channels ready
- **Have scenario cards printed/ready** to distribute at 13:50
- **Set up breakout rooms** for team coordination

### Monitoring Progress:
- **Circulate through breakout rooms** to ensure teams are forming properly
- **Help with research direction** if teams seem lost in details
- **Keep them focused** on extracting principles, not reading everything
- **Remind of time** - 10 minutes left, 5 minutes left

### Common Issues:

**"We can't find the incident reports":**
- Guide them to search for "post-mortem" or "incident report" 
- Suggest technology news sites as alternative sources
- Remind them: "Focus on principles, not perfect information"

**"These reports are too technical":**
- "Focus on the communication and coordination aspects"
- "Look for timeline information and decision points"
- "What would you do differently?"

**"We don't know enough about these technologies":**
- "The technology doesn't matter - focus on the response process"
- "How did they coordinate? How did they communicate?"

### Expected Preparation Outcomes:
By the end of 20 minutes, teams should have:
- **Clear role assignments** within their team
- **Basic understanding** of 1-2 major incidents
- **Key principles** about incident communication and coordination
- **Team coordination approach** for the upcoming drill

**Note:** The goal isn't deep expertise - it's rapid preparation for practical application!

## **Day 3: Operational Quality & Governance**

### **Learning Objective**
Implement data quality standards and governance controls in operations

### **Key Activities**
- **Morning Lab:** Build medallion architecture for data quality patterns
- **Quality Assessment:** Define and measure data quality metrics
- **Governance Workshop:** Implement data access controls and security
- **Case Study Analysis:** Solve real-world governance scenarios

### **Key Questions Explored**
- How do you ensure data operations meet quality standards?
- What governance controls are needed for operational compliance?
- How do you balance accessibility with security requirements?

### **Practical Outcomes**
- Data quality measurement framework established
- Security and access controls implemented
- Governance decision-making process defined

### **KSBs Covered**
- **S6:** Systematically clean, validate, and describe data (ETL)
- **S13:** Use data systems securely per procedures and legislation
- **S26:** Identify data quality metrics and frameworks
- **S27:** Select sustainable solutions for environmental strategies

**Duration:** Full day (9:30-16:00) | **Format:** Technical labs + governance case studies

## Day 3: Operational Quality & Governance
"Learn to maintain data standards and governance"

Learning Flow:

- Acquisition (45 mins): Data governance frameworks, quality dimensions
- Investigation (1 hour): Analyse governance policies in their workplaces
- Practice (2.5 hours):

Implement data quality checks (S26)
Set up data lineage tracking
Configure access controls and security (S13)

Discussion (45 mins): Balancing governance vs agility

Key Lab Ideas:

Data quality framework implementation
Security audit exercise
Governance policy creation workshop

Perfect! Keeping the days distinct makes much more sense. Let's map out Day 3:

## Day 3: Operational Quality & Governance

**Learning Objective:** Learn to maintain data standards and governance

### 9:30-9:50: Welcome & Quality Context (20 mins)

- **Discussion**: "What does 'good data' mean to you?"
- **Acquisition**: Data quality dimensions - accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness

### 9:50-10:30: Medallion Architecture Foundation (40 mins)

- **Practice**: Lab 3b (Medallion architecture) - 45 mins starts here
- Focus on the **why** behind bronze/silver/gold layers

### 10:30-10:50: Break (20 mins)

### 10:50-12:30: Quality Deep Dive (100 mins)

- **Practice**: Complete Lab 3b - remaining 25 mins
- **Investigation**: Data quality tools research (pairs) - 45 mins
  - Great Expectations, dbt tests, Azure Data Quality
  - What quality checks would you implement?
- **Discussion**: Medallion architecture benefits/challenges - 30 mins

### 12:30-13:30: Lunch (60 mins)

### 13:30-14:30: Governance & Security (60 mins)

- **Practice**: Lab 19 (Secure data access) - 45 mins
- **Discussion**: Security vs accessibility trade-offs - 15 mins

### 14:30-14:50: Break (20 mins)

### 14:50-15:45: Real-World Governance (55 mins)

- **Investigation**: Their workplace governance policies - 25 mins
- **Production**: Design data governance framework (pairs) - 30 mins

### 15:45-16:00: Wrap-up & Tomorrow Preview (15 mins)

This gives good balance between hands-on labs and the quality/governance investigations you want. The Great Expectations research fits perfectly with the medallion patterns!

Perfect! Let's restructure Day 3 with that focus:

## Day 3: Operational Quality & Governance (Revised)
**Learning Objective:** Learn to maintain data standards and governance

### 9:30-9:50: Welcome & Quality Foundation (20 mins)
- **Discussion**: "What does 'good data' mean to you?"
- **Acquisition**: Introduction to data quality - why it matters operationally

### 9:50-10:30: DMBOK Quality Investigation (40 mins)
- **Investigation**: DMBOK's 6 data quality dimensions (pairs) - 30 mins
  - Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Timeliness, Validity, Uniqueness
  - Find real workplace examples for each dimension
- **Discussion**: Report back findings - 10 mins
  - "How would you apply these in your organisation?"

### 10:30-10:50: Break (20 mins)

### 10:50-12:30: Medallion Architecture & Quality (100 mins)
- **Practice**: Lab 3b (Medallion architecture) - 45 mins
- **Discussion**: How do DMBOK dimensions map to bronze/silver/gold? - 30 mins
- **Investigation**: Quality tools research - Great Expectations, dbt tests - 25 mins

### Rest of day stays the same...

This gives them the DMBOK foundation first, then they can apply that knowledge practically through the medallion lab and see how quality evolves through the layers. Much better flow!

The investigation-to-application progression works really well with your pedagogical approach too.

## Day 3: Operational Quality & Governance ✅ STRUCTURED

- DMBOK quality dimensions investigation (Option 1 chosen)
- Lab 3b (Medallion) + Lab 19 (Security)
- Quality tools research (Great Expectations, etc.)
- Clear progression from quality theory to practice

---

Looking at what we designed for Day 3, here are the timings:

## Day 3: Operational Quality & Governance

### 9:30-9:50: Welcome & Quality Foundation (20 mins)
- Discussion: "What does 'good data' mean to you?"
- Acquisition: Introduction to data quality - why it matters operationally

### 9:50-10:30: DMBOK Quality Investigation (40 mins) ✅ CREATED
- Investigation: DMBOK's 6 data quality dimensions (pairs) - 30 mins
- Discussion: Report back findings - 10 mins

### 10:30-10:50: Break (20 mins)

### 10:50-12:30: Medallion Architecture & Quality (100 mins)
- Practice: Lab 3b (Medallion architecture) - 45 mins
- Discussion: How do DMBOK dimensions map to bronze/silver/gold? - 30 mins
- Investigation: Quality tools research - Great Expectations, dbt tests - 25 mins

### 12:30-13:30: Lunch (60 mins)

### 13:30-14:30: Governance & Security (60 mins)
- Practice: Lab 19 (Secure data access) - 45 mins
- Discussion: Security vs accessibility trade-offs - 15 mins

### 14:30-14:50: Break (20 mins)

### 14:50-15:45: Real-World Governance (55 mins)
- Investigation: Their workplace governance policies - 25 mins
- Production: Design data governance framework (pairs) - 30 mins

### 15:45-16:00: Wrap-up & Tomorrow Preview (15 mins)

**Issue:** We have the same workplace investigation problem as Day 2 - they can't research their workplace policies on the spot!

Should we redesign the afternoon or keep this structure?

# Fire Drill Scenario 2: Escalation Round

---

## Escalation Card (Give to ALL teams after break)

```
ðŸ”¥ ESCALATION UPDATE ðŸ”¥

TIME: 1 hour after initial incident (10:15 AM)
SITUATION DEVELOPMENT: Partial progress made, but new pressures emerging

TECHNICAL UPDATE:
â€¢ Initial fix implemented - pipeline is now running
â€¢ Dashboard showing some data, but still missing 40% of weekend records
â€¢ Data validation issue partially resolved, but root cause still unclear
â€¢ Estimated 2 more hours needed for complete data backfill and validation

STAKEHOLDER ESCALATION:
â€¢ BOARD MEETING HAPPENED: Sales Director had to present incomplete weekend numbers
â€¢ CEO now directly involved: "I need to understand what went wrong and when it will be fixed"
â€¢ Legal team contacted: Premium client Acme Corp formally complained about SLA breach
â€¢ Marketing Director: "Our biggest product launch campaign data is missing - this is a disaster"

NEW COMPLICATIONS:
â€¢ Data Protection Officer asking: "Do we need to report this as a data incident?"
â€¢ Vendor (data source) claims their system was fine - pointing blame back to us
â€¢ Media inquiry received: Tech journalist asking about customer data access issues
â€¢ Competitor's sales team reportedly contacting our clients about "reliability concerns"

IMMEDIATE DECISIONS NEEDED:
1. CEO wants personal briefing in 15 minutes - what do you tell them?
2. Legal team needs to know: Is this an SLA breach requiring customer compensation?
3. Communications team asking: Do we issue public statement or keep it internal?
4. Technical decision: Continue current fix or implement faster workaround?

YOUR CHALLENGE:
Balance technical accuracy with executive communication needs. 
Handle legal/compliance questions while managing competitive damage.
Coordinate response across multiple senior stakeholders with different priorities.

REMEMBER: CEO briefing in 15 minutes. All teams will present to CEO (facilitator role-playing).

## Facilitator Role-Play: CEO Briefing

### CEO Character Guidelines:
**Tone:** Professional but concerned, asking tough but reasonable questions
**Focus:** Business impact, timeline, prevention, accountability
**Style:** Direct questions, wants clear answers, limited technical patience

### Key CEO Questions to Ask Each Team:
1. **"In simple terms, what exactly went wrong?"**
2. **"When will this be completely fixed?"**
3. **"What's our liability exposure with client contracts?"**
4. **"How do we prevent this from happening again?"**
5. **"Should I be calling our major clients personally?"**
6. **"What resources do you need to resolve this faster?"**

### CEO Responses to Common Team Answers:

**If they're too technical:**
*"Translate that for someone who doesn't manage data pipelines"*

**If they give vague timelines:**
*"I need specific commitments - when exactly will customers see complete data?"*

**If they avoid blame/accountability:**
*"I'm not looking to blame anyone, but I need to understand what broke down"*

**If they focus only on technical fix:**
*"What about our client relationships and competitive position?"*

## Why This Escalation Works

### Realistic Complexity Increase:
- **Partial success creates new challenges** - not complete failure or complete success
- **Senior stakeholder involvement** - CEO, Legal, Data Protection Officer
- **External pressures** - media, competitors, formal complaints
- **Multiple decision domains** - technical, legal, communications, business

### Tests Different Skills:
- **Executive communication** - translating technical to business language
- **Risk assessment** - legal, financial, competitive implications  
- **Stakeholder prioritization** - who gets attention first
- **Decision-making under uncertainty** - incomplete information, time pressure

### CEO Briefing Adds Pressure:
- **Public presentation** - all teams present to "CEO"
- **Direct questioning** - immediate feedback on their decisions
- **Cross-team comparison** - see how different teams handled same escalation
- **Professional communication** - practice high-stakes stakeholder management

### Debrief Rich Material:
- **Compare CEO briefings** - which approaches were most effective
- **Analyze decision trade-offs** - technical vs. business priorities
- **Evaluate communication strategies** - internal vs. external messaging
- **Assess risk management** - legal, competitive, technical risks

This escalation significantly raises the stakes while staying realistic to what actually happens when incidents affect major business operations!

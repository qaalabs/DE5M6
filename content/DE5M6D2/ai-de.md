### 1. What is the role of AI in modern data pipelines?

- *Where in the data engineering lifecycle do you think AI or machine learning is already being usedâ€”or could be?*
- Encourage learners to consider areas like anomaly detection, schema inference, data classification, or automation in ETL.

### 2. Is AI replacing data engineersâ€”or empowering them?

- *Do tools like AutoML, AI code assistants, and automated data cleaning threaten the role of data engineers?*
- Let them explore both sidesâ€”efficiency vs. job evolution. Ask: *What skills will still be needed?*

### 3. Can AI be trusted with data quality and governance?

- *Could AI help maintain data quality, or might it introduce more risks?*
- Discuss examples like using AI for data deduplication or anomaly detectionâ€”and the risk of false positives or bias.

### 4. AI-generated code: helper or hazard?

- *Have you used or seen tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to generate SQL or pipeline code? How reliable is it?*
- Get them to critique AI-generated code and think about when human review is essential.

### 5. What does "responsible AI" mean for data engineers?

- *If youâ€™re building a pipeline that feeds an AI systemâ€”what ethical or design responsibilities do you have?*
- Touch on fairness, privacy, data lineage, and reproducibilityâ€”particularly relevant as engineers often work upstream of models.

### 6. Where do we draw the line between automation and understanding?

- *If AI builds and maintains the pipelineâ€”how much do we still need to understand it?*
- Let learners reflect on whether relying on automation may lead to loss of foundational understanding, and what that means for troubleshooting or innovation.

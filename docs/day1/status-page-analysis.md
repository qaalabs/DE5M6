# Status Page Analysis

**Learning Type:** Investigation  
**Format:** Pairs research with report back

## Setup Instructions (2 minutes)

1. **Form pairs** - mix experience levels if possible
2. **Assign each pair 1-2 status pages** from the list below
3. **Research task:** 10 minutes investigation + 3 minutes prep for sharing

## Status Pages to Research

Choose from these well-known status pages:

- **AWS:** https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status
- **Microsoft Azure:** https://status.azure.com/
- **Google Cloud:** https://status.cloud.google.com/
- **GitHub:** https://www.githubstatus.com/
- **Slack:** https://status.slack.com/
- **Stripe:** https://status.stripe.com/
- **Zoom:** https://status.zoom.us/

## Investigation Questions for Pairs

Provide each pair with these guiding questions:

**Current Status:**

- What's the overall system health right now?
- How is information organised? (by service, region, etc.)

**Historical Incidents:**

- Look at 1-2 recent incidents - what information is provided?
- How detailed are the updates?
- How frequently were updates posted?

**Communication Style:**

- How technical is the language?
- What do they tell users about impact?
- Do they explain what they're doing to fix it?

**What Works Well:**

- What would be helpful if you were a customer?
- What builds confidence that they're handling it?

## Report Back Session (3 minutes)

Each pair shares **one key insight** in 30 seconds:

- "The most interesting thing we noticed was..."
- "If we were designing a status page, we'd make sure to..."

## Facilitator Notes

- **If internet issues:** Have screenshots of status pages prepared as backup
- **Time management:** Keep sharing tight - use a timer
- **Follow-up questions:** "How does this connect to monitoring?" "What would happen without these status pages?"

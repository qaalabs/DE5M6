## <mark>Breakout group "report back" session</mark>

**Not much time is allocated to the report back ~ so keep sharing tight**

### Each group shares one key insight

- "The most interesting thing we noticed was..."
- "If we were designing a status page, we'd make sure to..."

### Follow-up questions

- How does this connect to monitoring?
- What would happen without these status pages?

## <mark>Investigation ~ Incident Response Prep</mark>

In the next session, you'll participate in an **incident response "fire drill"** simulating a data platform failure. You'll work in teams to coordinate technical responses and stakeholder communication under time pressure.

**But before we do that, it may be useful to read up on some real incidents that happened.**

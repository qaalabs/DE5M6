- You can plan, debate, and coordinate freely in your team room
- BUT - all **official communication** must go through the chat app

### Chat Communication Rules

- Use your chat app for incident updates to stakeholders
- This is how you communicate with customers, executives, and other teams
- Write professionally - these messages will be reviewed during debrief
- First action should be incident announcement to the channel

### Timing

- You have **25 minutes** to handle this incident

<mark>At the end we will debrief by looking at all the messages you sent!</mark>

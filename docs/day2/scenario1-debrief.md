# Scenario 1 ~ Debrief

## Scenario 1 Debrief Elements You Can Use:

**From the Scenario Card:**

- **Customer Dashboard Failure** - stale data since 6 AM
- **Multiple stakeholder pressure** - Sales Director, Customer Success, IT Director
- **Time pressure** - Board meeting at 10 AM (45 minutes)
- **Technical context** - Fabric pipeline failed, vendor data source changes

**Observable Team Behaviors:**

- **First response approach** - technical investigation vs. immediate communication
- **Stakeholder prioritization** - who did they contact first?
- **Communication timing** - how quickly did they update your status site?
- **Status update quality** - professional vs. technical language

**Optional Pressure Elements You Added:**

- Customer service call volume doubling
- Premium client Acme Corp threatening contract review
- Sales Director urgency about board meeting
- IT Director asking for technical details

## Debrief Questions That Work:

**Decision Comparison:**

- "Team A focused on customer communication first, Team B went straight to technical investigation - what are the pros/cons?"
- "Which approach would work better in your workplace?"

**Communication Analysis:**

- "Which status updates would have reassured you as a customer?"
- "How did teams balance technical details with business language?"

**Pressure Response:**

- "How did the escalating pressure messages affect your decision-making?"
- "When did you feel most/least confident in your approach?"

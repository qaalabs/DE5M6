## List of Dimensions of Quality
*By category and with descriptions*

### Core Value Dimensions

1. **Accuracy** – Is the data correct and free from errors?
2. **Completeness** – Are all required data fields present?
3. **Consistency** – Is the data uniform across sources and time?
4. **Validity** – Does the data follow accepted formats and rules?

### Time and Relevance

5. **Timeliness** – Is the data available when needed?
6. **Currency** – Is the data up to date?
7. **Volatility** – How often does the data change?
8. **Punctuality** – Was the data delivered on time?

### Structure and Uniqueness

9. **Uniqueness** – Are there duplicate records?
10. **Precision** – Is the data captured at the right level of detail?
11. **Granularity** – Is the data broken down at an appropriate level?
12. **Referential Integrity** – Are relationships between datasets maintained?

### Trust and Use

13. **Accessibility** – Can users access the data when needed?
14. **Credibility** – Is the data from a trusted source?
15. **Relevance** – Is the data fit for its intended use?
16. **Traceability** – Can the origin and changes to data be tracked?

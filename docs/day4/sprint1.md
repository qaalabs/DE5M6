## Tips for Sprint 1

#### If You're New to This:

- Start with **Quick Wins** to build confidence
- Focus on **understanding** rather than perfect implementation
- **Document your thinking** - that's valuable too!

#### If You Want to Code:

- **Configuration Externalization** is a great starting point
- **Logging Implementation** gives immediate visible results
- **Health Checks** are practical and useful

#### If You Like Strategy:

- **Gap Analysis** helps you think like a senior engineer
- **Monitoring Strategy** connects technical and business needs
- **Incident Response** is valuable for any role

#### If You're Cloud-Curious:

- **Azure Monitor** exploration is very relevant
- **Fabric Observability** shows the future of data platforms
